# MAM---Documentation

## Planning

We decided to split the application development into Backend and Frontend with Tom and Alisa handling them respectively. Alisa is stronger in react than Tom and since Tom handled the ADD and DFD and Alisa designed the wireframes in Part A, this pathway made the most sense.

Sprints will be weekly in duration with a standup on Mondays deciding the tasks to completed for the week. We will recovene at the end of the week to update each other on our progress. Informal communication will be ongoing throughout the week.

All tasks will be added to Trello as tickets with labels indicating person to complete the task, whether it's server or client and a difficulty rating. The ratings are 1-Easy, 2-Medium, 3-Hard, 5-Very Hard, 8-Needs Breaking Down, 11-Needs Break Down.

There are 5 weekly sprint between Part A submission and Part B submission. We anticipate they will be broken down this way:<br>
Week starting 14 December: Planning<br>
Week starting 21 December: First prototype<br>
Week starting 28 December: Aim for usable final product<br>
Week starting 4 December: User testing<br>
Week starting 11 December: Finalize documentation ready for submission
